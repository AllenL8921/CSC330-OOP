/**
 * Inheritance!
 * 
 * Allows for the sharing of code between classes.
 * 
 * Also allows for the addition (extension) of this class
 * ...adding data and functionality
 * 
 * the keyword in Java from inheritance is "extends"
 * 
 * ***IMPORTANT***
 * Inheritance relationships are called "IS-A" relationships
 * 
 * For example, a Dog "IS-A" Mammal
 * A Human "IS-A" Mammal
 * 
 * "IS-A" Human a Dog? no.
 * 
 * When a class (subclass or derived class) extends another (superclass or base class) 
 * the child inherits all protected and public data and behavior from the parent class
 * 
 * THE CHILD CLASS DOES NOT GET PRIVATE DATA OR METHODS!
 * CHILD CLASSES DO NOT INHERIT CONSTRUCTORS!!!!
